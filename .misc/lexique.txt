*.tpp files:
	function definitions of template classes
	that were declared in a .hpp header file
Usage:
	Include at the end of the .hpp file with an #include "ClassName.tpp" directive.

*.ipp files: (Often used in the same way as .tpp)
	sometimes might be used for inline functions
	or specialized template implementations, emphasizing implementation details.
Usage:
	Also included at the end of the .hpp file,
	but they can sometimes separate inline code thatâ€™s
	specific to certain template instantiations.
