What is the Role of Your IRC Server?
Central Hub for Communication:
The IRC server acts as a middleman. Clients (like Weechat or other IRC clients) connect to your server to send and receive messages.

Manages Connections:
The server accepts connections from multiple clients. Each connected client can:

Join chatrooms (called "channels").
Send direct messages to other users.
Leave or rejoin channels.
Implements the IRC Protocol:
The server communicates using a standard set of rules (IRC protocol). These rules define how:

A client connects and authenticates.
Messages and commands are formatted and handled.
Channels, users, and server events are managed.
Maintains State:
The server keeps track of:

Users: Who is connected and their nicknames.
Channels: Active chatrooms and their participants.
Messages: Sent and received messages, logs, etc.
How It Works with the Weechat Client
Weechat is an IRC clientâ€”a program that allows users to connect to an IRC server (like the one you're building) to chat.

Connection to Your Server:

You run your server on a specific IP address and port (e.g., 127.0.0.1:6667).
In Weechat, you configure a connection to your server by providing the address and port.
Commands:

Users in Weechat issue IRC commands (e.g., /nick, /join, /msg), which are sent to your server.
Your server interprets these commands, updates its state, and responds as needed.
Real-Time Messaging:

When a user sends a message in Weechat, the client sends it to your server.
Your server relays this message to the intended recipient(s) or channel(s).
The other users connected to your server see the message in their Weechat client.
Example Workflow
Start the Server:
You run your server application. It's now ready to accept connections on a specified port.

Connect with Weechat:

Open Weechat.
Configure it to connect to 127.0.0.1 (your server's IP) on port 6667 (or whatever port your server uses).
Authenticate using a nickname and optional password.
Join Channels and Chat:

Use /join #channel_name to create or join a channel.
Send messages to other users or channels.
Server Manages Everything:

Your server handles all the traffic and ensures messages go to the right users or channels.
Why Use Weechat?
Testing Your Server:
Weechat provides an easy way to test your server's functionality and adherence to the IRC protocol.

Real Client Experience:
You'll see how a real IRC client interacts with your server, helping you debug and improve the server's behavior.
