TOPIC

In the ft_irc project (an IRC server implementation),
the concept of a TOPIC is tied to the IRC protocol's TOPIC command,
which allows users to set or view the topic of a specific channel.

What is a Topic in IRC?

A topic is a short description or message associated with a channel.

It often conveys the purpose or current theme of the channel,
such as "General Chat" or "Discussing ft_irc Project."


Key Characteristics of Topics in IRC:

1. Associated with Channels:
	Each channel can have a topic.
	The topic is stored as part of the channel's metadata.

2. Settable by Users:
	By default, only channel operators (users with operator privileges)
	can set or modify the topic.
	However, this behavior can be modified by channel modes, such as +t:
		+t: Only channel operators can change the topic.
		-t: Any user in the channel can change the topic.

3. Viewable by All Users:
	Any user in the channel can view the topic (even if they can’t modify it).

4. Optional:
	A channel does not need to have a topic.
	If no topic is set, it will simply be empty.


The TOPIC Command in IRC

Command Syntax:
	To View the Topic:

		TOPIC <channel>

	If the channel has a topic, the server responds with the topic.
	If no topic is set, the server informs the user that the channel has no topic.

	To Set the Topic:

		TOPIC <channel> :<new topic>

If the user has the required privileges, the topic will be updated.
If the user lacks the privileges, the server will respond with an error.

Example Behavior:
	Viewing the Topic
		Command:
			
			TOPIC #general

		Server Response (if a topic is set):

			:server.name 332 <nick> #general :Welcome to the general discussion channel!
Server Response (if no topic is set):
:server.name 331 <nick> #general :No topic is set
Setting the Topic
Command:
TOPIC #general :Let's discuss the ft_irc project!
Server Response (if the topic is successfully set):
:<nick>!<user>@<host> TOPIC #general :Let's discuss the ft_irc project!
Server Response (if the user lacks privileges):
:server.name 482 <nick> #general :You're not a channel operator
Implementation Notes for ft_irc:
Topic Storage:

Store the topic as part of your Channel class or equivalent.
Ensure there’s a way to retrieve and update it.
Access Control:

Implement checks for channel modes (like +t) and user privileges before allowing a topic change.
Command Handling:

Parse the TOPIC command in your server code.
Respond appropriately based on the channel’s state, the user’s permissions, and the topic.
Edge Cases:

Handle cases where the channel does not exist.
Handle cases where no topic is set.
Respond with appropriate errors if the user lacks permission.
Relevant IRC Protocol Responses:
331: No topic is set for the channel.
332: Topic of the channel (sent after a successful TOPIC request).
482: The user does not have permission to change the topic.
By implementing the TOPIC command and integrating it into your ft_irc project, you’ll ensure proper topic management for your channels as per the IRC protocol specifications.
