/*
Params

JOIN: (already handled)
either one channel, a channel and a key, multiple channels, multiple channels and one or more keys..
#chan1,#chan2,#chan3,#chan4 key1,,*,key4
* edge case of using "0" as param **?

PART: 1 param, can be one or multiple channels
#chan1,#chan2,#chan3

TOPIC: 0 or 1 param (a #channel)
** need to handle the case when the trailing is detected (":" is present), but the content is an empty string.. **

MODE:	Change channel modes (i, t, k, o, l). (only these flags, and only MODE on channels)
this one is really complex..? i know its multi params..:
1 channel
mode(s)
modeparams..
** but i dont know how the mode params are written/formatted..
** or how to organize this for teammates access...

KICK: must be 2 params: can be 1 #channel and can be one or multiple user1,user2,user3
if a comment is given (trailing) it will be used instead of the default message, nickname of kicker?
(do we have a limit of targets ?)
we need to process multiparams as #channel being element 0, followed by one or multiusers ?

INVITE: ** not sure yet how i will handle multi params, so for now just a vector of 2 params,
nickname of the invited
and #channel

PRIVMSG: 1 or many params: target1,target2,#targetchan1

NOTICE: 1 or many params: target1,target2,#targetchan1

fix INVITE validator (valid nick, valid chan) -> more than one ?

fix the templates to take user_nickname





check if we remove /t from trim (rfc 1459 2.3.1)

add NUL to forbidden char in params

silently ignore numeric reply sent from client


reduce files by:

putting parsing_utils functions in class code (if doable)

handle commands to ignore in validateCommand() ? before checking through the commandMap..

add command syntax and example in each _validate* functions

utility function to validate param number, and if trailing should or should not exist?

utility function to apply a validation function on each multiparam of a string (ex, tokenize JOIN params, then call :
bool validMultiParam = paramIter(paramTokens[0], _isValidChannelName);

*****

fix _validate* functions to handle multi params:

**

******
QUIT

**
RPL_INVITELIST (336) 
  "<client> <channel>"
Sent to a client as a reply to the INVITE command when used with no parameter,
to indicate a channel the client was invited to
