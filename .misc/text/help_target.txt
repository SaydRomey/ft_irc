help: ## ⁉️  Display Available 'make' Targets
	@echo "\nAvailable targets:"

#
# Explanations:

BEGIN {FS = ":.*##";}

Sets the Field Separator (FS) to :.*##.

This means:
	Field $1 → Target name.
	Field $2 → The comment after ##.

# 

/^[a-zA-Z_0-9-]+:.*?##/

Matches lines that:
	Start with a valid Makefile target name (a-zA-Z_0-9-).
	Are followed by a colon (:).
	Contain ## for inline comments.

# 

printf " $(CYAN)%-15s$(RESET) %s\n", $$1, $$2

Prints:
	Target name ($$1) in cyan, left-aligned (%-15s).
	Comment ($$2) as the description.

# 

/^##@/

Matches lines starting with ##@.
Used for section headers.

# 

substr($$0, 5)

Prints everything after the first 4 characters (##@).
Used to display section headers in bold.

#
# Usage:

Standard Inline Documentation (Using ##)
We should use a short, concise description after ##.
Example:

---
clean: ## 🧹 Clean Object Files
fclean: ## 🧹 Full Clean, including executables
re: ## 🔄 Recompile everything
---

Section Headers (Using ##@)
Example:

---
##@ Compilation Targets

all: ## 🛠️ Build all modules
prompt_compile: ## 🚀 Prompt user to select module to compile

##@ Cleanup Targets

clean: ## 🧹 Clean object files
fclean: ## 🧹 Full clean (includes executables)
---

In the help target, these headers will appear bold,
separating different sections of your Makefile.

#
# Multiple-Line Descriptions

While inline comments (##) are typically one-liners,
we can add detailed descriptions using separate comment lines:

---
run: ## 🚀 Run a specific module
	## Run will:
	## - Prompt you to select a module
	## - Compile the module if it hasn't been compiled
	## - Execute the module
	@echo "Running..."
---

However, the help target only displays the first ## comment after the colon.

To make multi-line comments visible in the help target:

We should combine multiple lines into one
and use clear bullet points.
ex:

---
run: ## 🚀 Run a module | Prompts for module selection, compiles if needed, and executes.
---

We can add a Default Section Header
at the start of our Makefile:

---
##@ General Targets

help: ## ⁉️ Display available Makefile targets
---

# Example help Output:

***
Available targets:

🛠️ Compilation Targets
  all             Build all modules
  prompt_compile  Prompt user to select module to compile

🚀 Execution Targets
  run             Run a specific module | Prompts for module selection, compiles if needed, and executes.

🧹 Cleanup Targets
  clean           Clean object files
  fclean          Full clean (includes executables)
  re              Recompile everything

⁉️ Utility Targets
  help            Display available Makefile targets
  subject         Show subject file for a module
***

# Recap:

## is for single-line comments.
##@ is for section headers.

We should combine multi-line descriptions into single lines with clear formatting
and structure our Makefile logically with section headers.
