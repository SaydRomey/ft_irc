To merge specific files from other branch into the main branch

1. fetch and checkout the [struct/server] branch

	git fetch origin struct

to view the files in the struct branch

	git checkout struct

2. switch back to main

	git checkout main

3. merge specific files from struct
(we can merge specific files by specifying their paths relative to the repo root)

example, if files are

path/to/folder/file1.cpp
path/to/folder2/file2.hpp
path/to/folder3/file3.txt
path/to/folder4/file4.md

run the following commands:

git checkout struct -- path/to/folder/file1.cpp
git checkout struct -- path/to/folder2/file2.hpp
git checkout struct -- path/to/folder3/file3.txt
git checkout struct -- path/to/folder4/file4.md

these commands copy the files from the struct branch into our working directory on the main branch

4. stage and commit the changes
(after merging the files, add them to the staging area and commit them):

	git add path/to/folder/file1.cpp path/to/folder2/file2.hpp path/to/folder3/file3.txt path/to/folder4/file4.md
	git commit -m "merged specific files from struct branch into main branch"

5. push the changes to the remote repo

	git push origin main

now the specific files from the struct branch are merged into our main branch and pushed to the remote repo
