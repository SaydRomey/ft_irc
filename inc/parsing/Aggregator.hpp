/*
aggregating partial commands is directly related to parsing because
it ensures that fragmented input from a client
is correctly reassembled into complete commands
before being passed to your parser.

This is crucial for handling the non-blocking nature of IRC communication,
where data may not always arrive in a single packet.

What Are Partial Commands?

In an IRC server, commands sent by clients may arrive in fragments due to:

	Network latency or low bandwidth.
	The use of TCP, which doesn't guarantee packet boundaries.
	Larger messages being split across multiple TCP packets.

For example:

A client sends the command: PRIVMSG #channel :Hello, world!\r\n

Your server may receive the data in chunks:
	First packet: PRIVMSG #cha
	Second packet: nnel :Hello, w
	Third packet: orld!\r\n
If your parser attempts to process each chunk immediately,
it will fail to interpret the complete command correctly.

/*
TODO: Integrate the processData function into the serverâ€™s main loop,
where data is read from the socket.

For each client:

	Call processData(fd, incomingData) when new data arrives.
	Pass the extracted commands to the Parser.
